      <p>Iâ€™m a full-stack web developer from Michigan who almost definitely is addicted to coffee 
        at this point. I have a background and education in IT and do freelance web development 
        under my company, Popular Nerd LLC.

      I have a passion for problem solving all the way from design to backend server code. I love working with my clients to figure out tailored solutions for their exact problem and not just a one size fits all fix. If I am working with you on a project, big or small, that project is just as important to me as it is to your company. I take pride in everything I do and refuse to settle for anything less than the best I can create.
